      Happy Monday, neighbors!
      Ever accidentally close a browser tab with important work on it? Don't panic!
      You can bring it right back by pressing Ctrl + Shift + T (or Cmd + Shift + T on Mac).
      It's a lifesaver for those Monday morning clumsy fingers.
      Hope everyone has a productive week!

      Neighbor Alert: Pop-up Scams
      I've had two calls this week from folks who got a loud "VIRUS DETECTED" pop-up telling them to call a Microsoft number immediately.

      Please tell your parents/grandparents: Microsoft will NEVER put a phone number on your screen.

      If this happens:
      1. Don't call the number
      2. Don't click anything
      3. Force shut down (hold power button)

      Stay safe out there!

      Security Alert for Business Owners:
      Seeing an uptick in fake "Microsoft Support" pop-ups targeting small offices.

      Train your staff: Microsoft will NEVER display a phone number on screen.

      Response protocol:
      - Don't call or click
      - Force shutdown (hold power button)
      - Contact your IT support

      Parents - heads up on a common scam!
      Those scary "VIRUS DETECTED" pop-ups with a phone number? They're fake.

      Teach your kids: NEVER call those numbers. Just hold the power button to shut down.

      If it happens, message me - I can make sure nothing was compromised.

      Is your internet crawling today? Before you spend hours on hold with Spectrum or AT&T, try the "30-Second Rule."

      Unplug your router from power. Wait a full 30 seconds. Plug it back in.

      It sounds like a cliche ("Have you tried turning it off and on again?"), but it actually clears the cache and solves about 50% of connection issues.

      Let me know if that helps!

      Network troubleshooting 101:

      Before escalating to your ISP, try power cycling your router (unplug 30 seconds, replug).

      This clears the routing cache and resolves ~50% of connectivity issues without a support ticket.

      For persistent business connectivity issues, I offer same-day network diagnostics.

      WiFi acting up during homework time? Try this first:

      Unplug your router, wait 30 seconds, plug it back in.

      I know "turn it off and on again" sounds like a joke, but it really works about half the time!

      Start the week secure!

      If you're using the same password for Facebook, Email, and Banking... please change them today!

      If one site gets hacked, the bad guys try that password everywhere else.

      Recommendation: Use a Password Manager (like Bitwarden - it's free). You only remember one master password, and it generates secure ones for everything else.
      - Brandon, LB Computer Help

    b2b: |
      Security reminder for business owners:

      Are your employees reusing passwords across personal and work accounts?

      When a breach happens elsewhere, attackers try those credentials on business systems.

      Solution: Implement a password manager (Bitwarden, 1Password, LastPass) across your organization.

      Need help setting up company-wide password policies? I can help.

      Quick Tip to Spot a Fake Email:

      Got an email from "Amazon" or "Netflix" saying your account is locked?

      The Hover Test: Don't click! Just hover your mouse over the link. A box pops up showing the REAL website address.

      If it says "amazon-security-update.xyz.com" instead of just "amazon.com" - delete it immediately!

      Stay safe!
      - Brandon, LB Computer Help

    b2b: |
      Phishing awareness for your team:

      Train employees on the "hover test" - before clicking any email link, hover to preview the actual URL.

      Legitimate domains: amazon.com, paypal.com
      Phishing domains: amazon-secure-login.xyz.com, paypa1.com

      Want to schedule a security awareness training for your office? I offer on-site sessions.

      Teaching moment for the family:

      Show your kids the "hover test" - put your mouse over a link WITHOUT clicking. See the real website address pop up.

      If it looks weird (like netflix-secure.xyz.com), it's fake!

      Quick tip: If you use your laptop in bed or on the couch, put a book or tray under it!

      Laptops suck in air from the bottom to stay cool. Smother it with a blanket = overheating = shorter lifespan.

      Keep those vents clear!
      - Brandon, LB Computer Help

    b2b: |
      Remote work tip for your team:

      Employees working from home on laptops? Remind them: laptops on soft surfaces (beds, couches) block airflow and cause overheating.

      Overheating = thermal throttling = slower performance = frustrated workers.

      Simple fix: Laptop stand or even a book underneath.

      Is your computer running slow, but you don't want to buy a new one?

      The SSD Upgrade:
      If your computer is 3-4+ years old, it probably has an old "spinning" hard drive. Swapping it for a Solid State Drive (SSD) makes it literally 10x faster.

      It's like getting a new computer for a fraction of the price.

      I do these upgrades all the time - it's the best bang for your buck in tech!
      - Brandon, LB Computer Help

    b2b: |
      IT budget tip:

      Before replacing slow workstations, consider SSD upgrades.

      A $100-150 SSD upgrade can extend the life of 5-year-old hardware by 3+ years while dramatically improving employee productivity.

      ROI: Usually pays for itself in 2-3 months of reduced wait times.

      I do bulk SSD upgrades for offices. Let's talk.

      Kids complaining their computer is slow for gaming or school?

      Before buying new, try an SSD upgrade. It makes old computers feel brand new - seriously, 10x faster.

      I can do the upgrade and transfer all their files safely.

      Tech Myth Buster!

      MYTH: "You need to let your laptop battery drain completely before charging."

      TRUTH: Modern lithium batteries actually prefer partial charges. Plug in whenever you want - you won't hurt it!
