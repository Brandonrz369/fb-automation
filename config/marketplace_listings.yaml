# LB Computer Help - Facebook Marketplace Product Listings
# ========================================================
# STRATEGY: Frame every listing as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT, not a service.
# See memory/marketplace_strategy.md for full analysis.
#
# Facebook uses semantic AI (DeepText + LLM) to detect service listings.
# These listings are written to pass as product sales.
#
# RULES:
# - Title = Physical item + outcome (NEVER "service")
# - Description = what customer GETS, not what you DO
# - Photos = physical items (SSD, screen, cables, router)
# - Category = Electronics or Home Improvement
# - Flat pricing (product price, not hourly)
# - No "service/offer/hire/booking/consultation" words
# - No business name in title
# - Keep total active listings under 8 at a time (CORGI behavioral detection)
# - Space out posting by 1-2 days between listings

# ============================================
# PROVEN SURVIVORS (these 4 stayed up)
# Keep these as-is or tweak minimally
