# LB Computer Help - Group Rules Database (Business Page: LB Computer Help)
# ==========================================================================
# UPDATED: February 6, 2026
# PURPOSE: Track posting rules for groups the business page posts in
# HOW: Rules are captured during each posting session (agent visits About page first)
#
# NOTE: Business page has 38 groups. Many overlap with personal account.
# Strategy: Use business page for B2B groups + groups where personal already posted recently.
# NEVER post from both accounts to the same group in the same week.
#
# Rules are populated automatically during post sessions.
# The Browser Use agent visits /about BEFORE posting each time a group
# has rules_captured: false

# Business page groups will be added here as we begin posting from that account.
# For now, focus is on personal account Phase 2 launch.
#
# To populate: Run a Browser Use task from the business page profile to scrape
# /groups/joins/ and capture all group names + URLs, then add entries here.
