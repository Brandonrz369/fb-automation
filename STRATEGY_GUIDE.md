## 1. Posting Strategy (CRITICAL)

### Frequency Limits
| Metric | Safe Limit | Your Setup |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Daily posts (total) | 3-5 | 3-5 |
| Per-group frequency | 1x every 14 days | With 52 groups + 4/day = 13 day cycle |
| Hourly max | 5-6 posts | 1 post (good) |

### Optimal Timing (Pacific Time)
| Day | Best Windows |
|-----|--------------|
| Mon-Fri | 7-9 AM, 7-9 PM |
| Sat-Sun | 9-11 AM |

### Delays Between Posts
**CHANGE REQUIRED:** Your 15-45 minute delay is too fast.

**New setting:** Random delay of **65-140 minutes** between posts
- Prevents bot pattern detection
- Mimics human posting behavior

---

## 2. Content Rules (CRITICAL FOR SAFETY)

### The Golden Rules
1. **NEVER put links in main post text** - kills reach by 80% + triggers spam
   - Put link in FIRST COMMENT instead
   - Or say "DM me for details"

2. **NEVER post identical content to multiple groups**
   - Facebook AI fingerprints detect this instantly
   - Need 5+ text variations per content piece

3. **Vary opening sentences** - most important line for detection

### Content Types That Work (Ranked)

| Type | Engagement | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| "Disaster Porn" | HIGHEST | Dusty fan photos with "This is what 3 years of pet hair does..." |
| "Safety Alert" | HIGH | Scam warnings with screenshots |
| "Local Hero" | HIGH | "Saved a student's thesis today..." |
| "Quick Tip" | MEDIUM | Browser shortcuts, speed tips |
| "Soft Sell" | LOW | "3 slots left this week, DM me" |

### The 40-30-20-10 Rule
- **40%** Interaction (polls, questions, local hot takes)
- **30%** Value/Education (tips, how-tos, warnings)
- **20%** Community (behind-scenes, local events)
- **10%** Promotional (soft sells only)

---

## 3. Automation Safety (CRITICAL)

### Pre-Post Routine (Add to Browser Use Script)
1. Navigate to group
2. **Scroll feed for 30-60 seconds** (human behavior)
3. **Like 1 random post** before posting yours
4. Then create your post

### The "10:1" Engagement Rule
For every 1 promotional post, engage with 10 non-business posts:
- Like friends' photos
- Comment on local news
- React to community posts

**This protects your personal profile from being flagged as commercial.**

### Warning Signs (STOP IMMEDIATELY IF SEEN)
| Sign | Action |
|------|--------|
| CAPTCHA prompts | Stop 24 hours, check IP |
| Random logouts | Change password, pause 72 hours |
| 0 likes on 3+ posts | Shadowbanned - pause 1 week |
| "This looks like spam" popup | Stop ALL automation 72 hours |

### Recovery If Restricted
1. Stop all automation immediately
2. Manually log in on phone
3. Like friends' photos, act normal
4. Wait 72 hours minimum
5. Resume at 50% volume

---

## 4. Group Management

### Tier Your 52 Groups
| Tier | Type | Priority | Example |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| A (Goldmines) | Community/Parents | Highest | "Living in [City]", "Parents of [City]" |
| B (Marketplace) | Buy/Sell | Medium | "OC Classifieds", "Garage Sale" |
| C (General) | City groups | Lower | General "[City] CA" groups |

### When to Archive a Group
- Post gets 0 engagement for 3 cycles in a row
- Admin declines post twice
- Rules prohibit business posts

### Leaving Groups Safely
**Note:** Group cleanup completed Feb 5, 2026 - all non-OC groups removed.

If needed in future:
- Max 10-12 groups per day
- Spread throughout day (3 morning, 3 lunch, 6 evening)
- Only during normal hours (9 AM - 8 PM)

## 5. Photo Best Practices

### What Works
- **Raw, unpolished photos** (authenticity)
- Close-ups of dusty components
- Before/after side-by-side
- You holding the fixed device
- Local landmarks in background

### What to Avoid
- Canva graphics (looks like ads)
- Text overlays on images
- Stock photos
- Over-edited photos
- Logo watermarks

## 6. Metrics to Track

### Success Indicators
| Metric | Goal | Why |
|--------|------|-----|
| Comments | 2+ per post | Algorithm boost |
| DMs received | 1+ per day | Conversion |
| "How much?" questions | Any | Hot lead |

### Warning Indicators
| Metric | Concern | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 0 likes 3x in row | Shadowban | Pause 1 week |
| Posts not appearing | Filtered | Check with alt account |
| Admin messages | Warning | Review group rules |

## 8. Sample Post Templates

### Dusty Computer (Your Specialty)
```
Opened up a laptop for a neighbor in [CITY] today.

This is what [X] years of [pet hair/dust/crumbs] does to your cooling fan!

If your laptop sounds like a jet engine or gets super hot, this is probably why.

[PHOTO]

Easy fix - runs whisper quiet now. Stay cool out there OC!
```

### Scam Warning
```
Heads up [CITY] folks - seen 3 of these fake "Microsoft Virus" pop-ups this week.

DO NOT call the number. It is a scam.

Just force restart your computer (hold power button 10 seconds).

Stay safe out there!

[SCREENSHOT]
```

### Soft Sell
```
Got 3 slots open this week for computer tune-ups.

If your PC has been running slow or making weird noises, now's a good time to get it checked before it becomes a bigger problem.

DM me if interested - I come to you!
```
