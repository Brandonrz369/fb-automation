## Template 1: Dusty Computer ("Disaster Porn")
**Best For:** Community groups, highest engagement
**Photo:** Before/after dusty fan cleaning

### Variation A
```
Hey OC neighbors!

Opened up a laptop for a neighbor in [CITY] today.

This is what 3 years of pet hair does to your cooling fan!

If your laptop sounds like a jet engine or gets super hot, this is probably why.

Easy fix - runs whisper quiet now.

DM me if yours needs some TLC!
```

### Variation B
```
Hi Orange County folks!

Just finished cleaning out this desktop from [CITY].

The owner said it kept shutting down randomly - no wonder, look at all that dust blocking the airflow!

30 minutes later and it runs like new.

Anyone else's computer running hot lately?
```

### Variation C
```
What's up everyone!

Check out what I pulled out of a laptop today in [CITY].

Years of dust, crumbs, and who knows what else clogging up the fan.

No wonder it was overheating and running slow!

Quick cleanup and it's good as new. Your computer might need the same thing!
```

### Variation D
```
Hello neighbors!

Here's your reminder to get your computer cleaned once in a while.

This is from a laptop in [CITY] - the fan was completely blocked with dust.

Owner thought they needed a new computer. Nope, just needed a good cleaning!

Runs perfect now.
```

### Variation E
```
Hey [CITY] area!

Before and after on this dusty boy.

3 years of buildup was making it overheat and throttle down to protect itself.

If your computer is slow or hot, this might be why!

Happy to take a look - just send me a message.
```

## Template 2: Security Warning / Scam Alert
**Best For:** All groups, high shareability
**Photo:** Screenshot of fake virus popup (blur phone numbers)

### Variation A
```
Heads up Orange County folks!

Seen 3 of these fake "Microsoft Virus" pop-ups this week in the [CITY] area.

DO NOT call the number. It is a SCAM.

Just force restart your computer (hold power button 10 seconds).

Please share so your friends and family don't fall for this!
```

### Variation B
```
PSA for OC neighbors:

If you see a popup like this saying your computer has a virus and to call a number - DON'T DO IT.

It's a scam. Microsoft will never show you a popup like this.

Just close your browser or restart your computer.

Tag someone who needs to see this!
```

### Variation C
```
Warning for [CITY] and surrounding areas:

These fake virus popups are going around again.

They try to scare you into calling and paying hundreds of dollars for "support."

It's 100% a scam. Just restart and you're fine.

Share to protect your neighbors!
```

## Template 3: Success Story / Save
**Best For:** Community groups, builds trust
**Photo:** You holding fixed device or happy workspace

### Variation A
```
Good day today!

Saved a college student's thesis from a crashed hard drive this morning in [CITY].

4 years of work - they thought it was gone forever.

Managed to recover everything. The relief on their face was priceless!

Backup your files, folks!
```

### Variation B
```
Happy ending in [CITY] today!

A small business owner's computer wouldn't turn on - they had years of client records on it.

Turned out to be a simple power supply issue. All their data was safe.

Don't panic if your computer dies - there's usually a fix!
```

### Variation C
```
Love days like this.

Family in [CITY] thought they lost all their photos when their laptop died.

Spent a couple hours on it and recovered everything - 10 years of memories!

Always have a backup, but if you don't, all hope isn't lost.
```

## Template 4: Educational Tip
**Best For:** All groups, positions you as expert
**Photo:** Optional, can be text-only

### Variation A
```
Quick tip for my OC neighbors:

Is your computer running slow? Before you buy a new one, try this:

1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager
2. Click "Startup" tab
3. Disable programs you don't need starting automatically

This alone can speed up your boot time by minutes!
```

### Variation B
```
Free speed tip for [CITY] folks:

Your browser might be eating all your RAM.

If you have 20+ tabs open (no judgment, we all do it), try installing an extension that suspends inactive tabs.

Your computer will thank you!
```

### Variation C
```
Tech tip Tuesday!

If your laptop battery dies fast, check your power settings:

1. Click battery icon in taskbar
2. Drag slider toward "Best battery life"
3. Close apps you're not using

Can add hours to your battery life!
```

Slow computer? Virus issues? Hardware problems? I come to you!

**Photo:** None needed

### Variation A
```
Question for my OC tech friends:

What's the most frustrating thing about your computer right now?

Slow startup? Random crashes? Something else?

Curious what everyone's dealing with!
```

### Variation B
```
Poll for [CITY] neighbors:

How old is your main computer?

A) Less than 2 years
B) 2-5 years
C) 5-10 years
D) I don't even want to know

No judgment - I've seen some ancient machines still running!
```

### Variation C
```
Tech confession time:

What's the longest you've gone without restarting your computer?

I'll go first - had a client last week who hadn't restarted in 6 months. SIX MONTHS.

Your turn!
```
