## MSP Value Proposition

### What is MSP? (Elevator Pitch)
> "Instead of calling someone when things break, you pay a flat monthly fee and I prevent problems before they happen. Think of it like having your own IT department, but at a fraction of the cost."

### Core MSP Services to Promote

| Service | Monthly Value | Pain Point Solved |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Proactive Monitoring** | $50-150/endpoint | "We only find out something's wrong when it crashes" |
| **Managed Backups** | $100-300/server | "We lost everything when the server died" |
| **Security Management** | $100-500/month | "We got hit by ransomware" |
| **Help Desk Support** | $500-1500/month | "We waste hours waiting for IT help" |
| **Network Management** | $200-800/month | "Our WiFi is always dropping" |

### Differentiators for Small Business

| LB Computer Help Advantage | vs. Big MSPs |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| Local, same-day response | They're in another city |
| You talk to Brandon directly | You get a ticket number |
| Flexible, no long contracts | 3-year lock-ins |
| Right-sized for small biz | Overbuilt enterprise solutions |
| Knows OC business community | Generic service |

## B2B Content Strategy

### Content Pillars (4 Types)

#### 1. Problem/Solution Posts (40%)
> "Had a client this week whose 'slow computer' turned out to be a failing hard drive with 3 years of QuickBooks data. We caught it just in time.
>
> Quick tip: If your computer is making clicking sounds, back up IMMEDIATELY.
>
> For my business clients, I monitor drives 24/7 so we replace them BEFORE they fail. That's the difference between 'break-fix' and managed IT."

**Photo:** Hard drive or backup system

#### 2. Security Alerts (25%)
> "Business owners: New phishing scam targeting QuickBooks users. The email looks legitimate but the link goes to a fake login page.
>
> How to spot it:
> - Check the sender's actual email address
> - Hover over links before clicking
> - When in doubt, go directly to QuickBooks.com
>
> My managed clients get email filtering that blocks these automatically. DM me if you want to know more."

**Photo:** Screenshot of phishing email (redacted)

#### 3. Credibility/Case Studies (20%)
> "Just finished setting up a new network for a 15-person law firm in Irvine. They were running on consumer-grade equipment from Best Buy - constant disconnects, security vulnerabilities, no backup plan.
>
> Now they have:
> ✓ Business-class firewall
> ✓ Managed switches with VLANs
> ✓ Automatic cloud backup
> ✓ 24/7 monitoring
>
> Their words: 'We didn't know IT could just... work.'
>
> [Photo of clean network rack - anonymized]"

**Photo:** Network rack photos (IMG_1308.jpg, IMG_1309.jpg)

#### 4. Thought Leadership (15%)
> "3 IT mistakes I see small businesses make:
>
> 1. No backup strategy (or backups that don't actually work)
> 2. Everyone using the same password
> 3. Running Windows 10 past the 2025 end-of-support date
>
> Which one is your business guilty of? Be honest in the comments..."

## Posting Guidelines

### Frequency (Business Page)
| Day | Content Type | Group Tier |
|-----|--------------|------------|
| Monday | Problem/Solution | Tier 1 business groups |
| Wednesday | Security Alert OR Case Study | Tier 2 niche groups |
| Friday | Thought Leadership | Tier 1 business groups |

### Tone & Language

**DO:**
- "Business owners..."
- "For my commercial clients..."
- "Small businesses in OC..."
- "Monthly support plans"
- "Proactive IT management"

**DON'T:**
- "Hey neighbors!" (residential tone)
- "My rates are..." (too salesy upfront)
- "DM for prices" (looks spammy)
- Technical jargon without explanation

### Engagement Rules
1. **Respond to comments within 2 hours** during business hours
2. **Answer questions publicly** (shows expertise to lurkers)
3. **Move to DM only for pricing discussions**
4. **Follow up on leads within 24 hours**

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Posts per week | 3 | Manual count |

## Next Steps

1. **Research:** Find 10-15 OC business networking groups to join
2. **Create:** Write 5 B2B-focused posts using templates above
3. **Join:** Add groups with Business Page (NOT personal profile)
4. **Wait:** 48-hour intro period
5. **Launch:** Begin posting schedule

*This strategy complements the residential automation (personal profile) but runs as a separate, more hands-on effort due to the higher-touch nature of B2B sales.*
